# Security Summary - Multi-File Upload Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the multi-file upload feature.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Nonce Verification ✅
**Location:** `includes/Modules/Legacy/Original.php:526`
```php
check_ajax_referer('aura_upload_artwork', 'upload_nonce');
```
- All upload requests require valid WordPress nonce
- Prevents CSRF attacks
- Nonce created with `wp_create_nonce('aura_upload_artwork')`

### 2. File Type Validation ✅
**Location:** `includes/Modules/Legacy/Original.php:583-589`
```php
$allowed_mimes = array(
    'png'  => 'image/png',
    'jpg'  => 'image/jpeg',
    'jpeg' => 'image/jpeg',
    'pdf'  => 'application/pdf'
);
```
- Only allowed MIME types accepted
- WordPress `wp_handle_upload()` validates file types
- Prevents execution of malicious files

### 3. File Sanitization ✅
**Location:** Multiple locations
```php
sanitize_file_name()      // For filenames
pathinfo(..., PATHINFO_FILENAME)  // Extract safe filename
basename()                 // Get safe basename
```
- All filenames sanitized before storage
- Path traversal prevention
- No user-controlled file paths

### 4. Secure File Storage ✅
**Location:** `includes/Modules/Legacy/Original.php:651-658`
```php
$dirs['subdir'] = '/' . $sub;  // Force /aura-artwork/ directory
$dirs['path']   = $dirs['basedir'] . $dirs['subdir'];
```
- Files stored in dedicated `/wp-content/uploads/aura-artwork/` directory
- No date-based subdirectories for simpler access control
- Files inherit WordPress upload directory permissions

### 5. Size Limits ✅
**Location:** `includes/Modules/Legacy/Original.php:475`
```php
$max_mb = 10; 
$max_bytes = $max_mb * 1024 * 1024;
if (... && filesize($path) <= $max_bytes) { ... }
```
- Email attachments limited to 10MB per file
- Prevents server overload
- Protects against DoS via large files

### 6. Input Sanitization ✅
**Location:** Multiple locations
```php
sanitize_text_field()     // For text inputs
intval()                  // For IDs
esc_url_raw()            // For URLs
sanitize_file_name()      // For filenames
```
- All user inputs sanitized
- Type coercion for integers
- URL validation for links

### 7. Output Escaping ✅
**Location:** Multiple locations in email generation
```php
esc_html()               // For HTML output
esc_url()               // For URL output
wp_kses_post()          // For post content
```
- All output properly escaped
- Prevents XSS attacks
- Context-aware escaping

### 8. WordPress API Usage ✅
- Uses `wp_handle_upload()` for file uploads
- Uses `wp_insert_attachment()` for attachment creation
- Uses `wp_mail()` for email sending
- Leverages WordPress security features

### 9. Error Handling ✅
```php
if ($files['error'][$i] !== UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
    continue; // Skip files with errors
}
```
- Graceful error handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Failed uploads don't break entire process

### 10. Access Control ✅
- AJAX endpoints use WordPress nonce system
- Files only accessible through WordPress attachment system
- No direct file URL execution

## Potential Security Concerns (None Found)

### ✅ SQL Injection
- Not applicable - no direct database queries
- Uses WordPress `get_post_meta()` and `update_post_meta()`

### ✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- All output escaped with appropriate functions
- HTML sanitization where needed
- No eval() or innerHTML usage

### ✅ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Nonce verification on all AJAX requests
- WordPress nonce system properly implemented

### ✅ File Upload Vulnerabilities
- MIME type validation
- File extension checking via WordPress
- Secure storage location
- Size limits enforced

### ✅ Path Traversal
- All file paths sanitized
- No user-controlled paths
- WordPress upload_dir filter properly used

### ✅ Remote Code Execution
- Only safe file types allowed (images, PDF)
- No executable files permitted
- Files stored in upload directory with proper permissions

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Ensure `/wp-content/uploads/` has proper permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
   - Configure web server to prevent PHP execution in uploads directory
   - Consider adding `.htaccess` to block script execution

2. **WordPress Configuration**
   - Keep WordPress core and plugins updated
   - Use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - Enable 2FA for admin users

3. **File Upload Limits**
   - Configure `upload_max_filesize` in php.ini
   - Configure `post_max_size` in php.ini
   - Configure `max_file_uploads` if needed

4. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor upload directory for unusual files
   - Log all upload attempts
   - Set up alerts for failed upload attempts

5. **Backup**
   - Regular backups of upload directory
   - Include backups in disaster recovery plan

## Security Testing Performed
